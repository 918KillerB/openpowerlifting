Meet data is stored in CSV format.

[ 0] YEAR, always 4 digits.
[ 1] MONTH, always 2 digits.
[ 2] DAY, always 2 digits.
[ 3] COUNTRY, usually "USA".
[ 4] STATE, where applicable.
[ 5] TOWN, where reported.
[ 6] NAME, the optional name of the meet.

Lift data is stored in CSV format.

The goal of the format is to contain all uncalculatable lift information.
Information that may be inferred from the data, such as totals, wilks, or specific records,
should be calculated.

The format is standardized for squat/bench/deadlift powerlifting. Some organizations include
other lifts, such as the overhead press or barbell curls, and do not fit this format.

All weights are in kg, unless otherwise specified by appending "lbs" to the field.
Fields below that say "in kg" may be written as, e.g. for the squat, "-202.5*lbs".

Note that lifters may be competing in more than one division, for example
both in Masters and in Open. Such lifters will receive multiple entries.

# General details for all lifters.
[ 0] NAME, in First Middle Last order. The middle name is optional.

[ 1] UID, an optional number used to uniquely identify a lifter across meets.
     Blank if a UID is not being used.

# Entry details for this particular competition.
[ 2] SEX, M or F.

[ 3] BODYWEIGHT, in kg. Sometimes meet results don't record the bodyweight, but only record
     the weight class in which the lifter competed. In that case, BODYWEIGHT will be blank.

[ 4] WEIGHTCLASS, either kg or "SHW". The range of the weightclass must be tracked per-federation.
     The Super-Heavyweight class (SHW, usually 308+) is recorded as "SHW".

[ 5] AGE, in years. Sometimes meet results don't record the age, but only record
     the division in which the lifter competed, such as "Women's Open".
     In that case, AGE will be blank. If the lifter is tracked via UID across several years,
     AGE can be retroactively discovered and filled in.

[ 6] DIVISION, a text field. Lifters in the same division compete against each other via the
     Wilks formula (usually). Examples are "Women's Open" and "Teen Men 13-16".
     If the lifter is competing Bench-Only or Deadlift-Only, this is tracked in the division
     as, for example, "Bench-Only Women's Open".

[ 7] EQUIPMENT, a text field. Normal entries are "Raw", "Wraps", "Single-Ply", and "Multi-Ply".
     May be left blank if unspecified.

# Lift details.
# If a lift is entered as a negative value, the lift has been failed.
# If a lift is blank, it was never attempted.
# If only the max lift was recorded, it is left in the first slot.
