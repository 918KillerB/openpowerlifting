USPA conveniently numbers their meets and hosts results in a single location:
  http://uspla.org/home/competition-results

To convert a modern (post-2010 or so) meet result spreadsheet PDF to CSV:
  1.  Create a folder named after the unique meet number.
  2.  Download the results PDF into that folder.
  3.  Run `pdftotext -layout *.pdf`.
  4.  Rename the output text file to results.txt
  5.  Delete the original PDF file.
  6.  Manually edit results.txt to vertically align columns.
  7.  From within the folder, run ../uspatocsv on results.txt, changing results.txt until it passes.
  8.  Redirect the output of `../uspatocsv results.txt` as lifters.csv.
  9.  Manually create meet.csv using the header in results.txt.
  10. Add the new folder to git and push.

With regard to the Wilks column, USPA sometimes publishes scores marked Wilks
that include the McCulloch age coefficient. These scores should be treated as
incorrect and fixed, since Wilks and McCulloch are separately tracked.
